# Glimpse
Glimpse is a location based application that aims to provide the most up to date information related to local promotions and sales to its buyers. Local businesses often have small scale promotions or one day deals that are communicated to clients in person as they enter the store. This app will give these businesses a platform to advertize such sales to a wider audience. It will help with giving them exposure to potential clients who are passing by.

The main objective of the application is to efficiently advertise promotions that might have otherwise gone unnoticed to likely clients. Buyers will be able to see the sales that are taking place in the stores or businesses close by. It is providing them with relevant information based on their current location.

Glimpse will offer its users a map view of the available promotions as well as a mosaic view where these promotions will be displayed as tiles. One of the main features of the application is the follow option which allows users to be more selective and follow their favorite businesses and see their promotions on the map. The users will also be able to receive notifications from the vendors they are following as soon as there is a new promotion. Another great feature is the live chat option which provides a communication channel between the users and the business.

In terms of tracking how much exposure a promotion has received, the number of users that have seen it will be displayed and visible for the business it originated from. We envision this mobile application to be an innovative marketing tool that is able to keep up with daily changes and challenges of a local commercial market.
